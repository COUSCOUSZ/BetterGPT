 ## BetterGPT (WiP)

- ⚠️I will be reworking the following:
  - Migrate to [wxt](https://wxt.dev/), I was using [crxjs.dev](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin).
  - Rework the way of selecting the dom , previously I was depending on MutationObserver which i find not good for performance and it's kinda tricky. Now I'll be relying on [chrome.webRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) API as an event to select the dom whenever a request response is returned.
 
- Feel free to contribute. 

- BetterGPT is a chrome extension that aims to add quality of life features to chatGPT.

- The main one is the message list of current chat to scroll fast between messages without doing it manually.

- Other features are planned : Bookmarking messages & chats , maybe support for other chatbots like claude , gemini ...

  > ( still have to load when other events occur , eg: when a message is sent ).
